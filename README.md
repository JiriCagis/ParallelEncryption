<h1> Parallel encryption </h1>
This program was created as schoool project in a subject parallel computing. The program use symetric cypher algorithm on block bytes. So you can cypher any file, it does not depend on file types. Cypher uses substitution, permution and matrix strategies. 128 bit key assures safety harden break with keygen.

<h3> Main functions </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Symetric cypher</li>
	<li>Block bytes cypher independ on file</li>
	<li>Force security in 128 bit key</li>
	<li>Parralel work on many thread processor</li>
</ul>

<h3> Technologies </h3>
- Programming language: C++
- Parallel framework: OpenMP
