<h1> Parallel encryption </h1>
This program will created as school project in subject parallel computing.
Program use symetric cypher algortihm on block bytes. So you must cypher
any file, not depend type. For cypher is used substitution, permutation and matrix strategies.
Safety do 128bit key assure harder break with keygen.

<h3> Main function </h3>
- Symetric cypher
- Block bytes cypher independ on file
- Force security in 128 bit
- Parralel work on many thread processor

<h3> Technologies </h3>
- Programming language: C++
- Parralel framework: OpenMP
